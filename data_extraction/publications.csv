For this study, 168 Pakistani families with autosomal recessive hearing impairment not due to mutations in the GJB2 (Cx26) gene underwent a genome scan. Two-point and multipoint parametric linkage analyses were carried out...."
Localization of a novel autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing impairment locus DFNB55 to chromosome 4q12-q13.2,"Saba Irshad, R L P Santos, D Muhammad, [...], S M Leal",Oct 2005,Article,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7662539_Localization_of_a_novel_autosomal_recessive_non-syndromic_hearing_impairment_locus_DFNB55_to_chromosome_4q12-q132,"Hereditary hearing impairment (HI) is the most genetically heterogeneous trait known in humans. So far, 54 autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing impairment (ARNSHI) loci have been mapped, and 21 ARNSHI genes have been identified. Here is reported the mapping of a novel ARNSHI locus, DFNB55, to chromosome 4q12-q13.2 in a consanguineous Pakistani..."
